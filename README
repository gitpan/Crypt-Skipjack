Crypt::Skipjack
===============

Skipjack is the secret key encryption algorithm designed by the
National Security Agency, and is used in the Clipper chip and Fortezza
PC card. It was implemented in tamper-resistant hardware and its
structure had been classified since its introduction in 1993. Skipjack
was unclassified on June 24, 1998.

Skipjack is an 80-bit key, 64-bit block cipher.

BONUS

The C file, _skipjack.c, is a standalone Skipjack implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _skipjack.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:
